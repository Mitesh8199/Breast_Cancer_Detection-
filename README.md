# Cancer_Detection

This project Classifies between whether a patient has a cancer or not.

### Steps:
1. Data Upload
2. Data Preprocessing
  - Missing data interpretation
  - Correlation between columns
  - Feature description
  - Feature Encoding
  - Standardisation
3. Train- Test Split.
4. Created a Function in which all the machine algorithms are entered.
5. Model Evaluation.
